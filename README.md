Next Haunt is student group based in the Next House, which creates and operates a Halloween haunted real-life escape the room game for the MIT community. Real-life escape the room games are physical adventures in which groups are locked in a room and must use elements in the room to solve a series of puzzles, find clues, and escape the room within a set time limit.
